###### Proper Definition of a Myth
- Myths are culturally significant stories that have to do with gods, goddesses, or a singular deity. Myths are often tied to religious tradition, passed down through generations, and the deities in these Myths often interact with humans. As a result, Myths are often used in many cultures to build a narrative that explain the workings of the world.

###### Folklore Categories:
- **Myths:** stories that specifically deal with gods and goddesses or a singular god or goddess often interacting with humans.

- **Legends:** stories with a kernel of historical truth to them. They focus on human heroes that are often the children of the gods.

- **Fairy Tales:** stories with nobles hidden in disguise helped or harmed by supernatural powers like fairy godmothers and wicked witches.

- **Tall Tales:** exaggerated stories that focus on regular folk with extraordinary abilities like the tales of Paul Bunyan.

- **Folk Tales:** stories of everyday people like the butcher, baker, candlestick maker, who are usually depicted as smarter than the nobility.

- **Fables:** stories that use animals as the main characters and have a moral lesson, like the tale of the Rabbit and Tortoise.

###### Joseph Campbell's Four Functions of Myth:
1. **The Mystic or Metaphysical Function** - Reconciles consciousness with the preconditions of its own existence, namely that life feeds on life. Life is monstrous. This function helps us move beyond the horror and find a way to say “yes” to life.
2. **The Cosmological Function** - Makes the world around the culture sacred. Whether the culture lives in a desert or a jungle or temperate mountains, the landscape becomes associated with the gods.
3. **The Sociological Function** - Validates the social order, authorizes that society’s moral code, tells everyone how the society is structured and who holds power

4. **The Psychological Function** - Shapes individuals to the course of life within the sociological order, from birth through all the stages of life until death

###### Six Most Common Types of Creation Myths: 
1. **Emergence Myths:** Creation seems to emerge from the Earth, from layers beneath it, or from the Earth herself as a goddess. Everything emerges from her as if from her womb. Things grow within her and emerge when they are fully grown. The primary focus is on the feminine rather than the masculine in Emergence myths. 

2. **Creation from Chaos Myths**: Creation comes from chaos or the void, which is often described as watery chaos. The chaos may also be symbolized by a monster or a serpent. 

3. **Cosmic Egg Myths**: Creation or the first deity comes from a cosmic egg. The egg symbolizes fertility and contains all the potency for creation. Created order proceeds from the primordial perfection that was within the egg. 

4. **Creation from Nothing Myths**: This type of myth contains a primordial being that always was and always is. The being is usually a male or beyond gender. He exists from the beginning without any explanation and the other thing in existence is usually cosmic water. The being often becomes associated with the sky. It beyond the earth, and not dependent upon it, but transcendent to it.  

5. **World-parent Myths**: Creation comes from the reproduction of the world parents. The world parents may be indifferent to their offspring or even unaware of them. The world-parents may appear after the initial beginning from chaos. The offspring are often instrumental in separating the world parents. 

6. **Earth-Diver Myths**: Everything is water in the beginning, similar to chaos. A cultural hero that is usually an animal dives down into the water and emerges with the first bit of dirt or earth that becomes eventually the first landmass.
