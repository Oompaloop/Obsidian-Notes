#### Topic 6: Moments and Centers of Mass

###### Introduction
*In calculus, the center of mass is a fundamental concept used to describe the average location of the mass distribution within a system or object. It represents the point at which an object would balance perfectly if supported. The center of mass is calculated using integrals to determine the weighted average position of all the individual mass elements that make up the object.

*For continuous distributions of mass, such as a solid object or a region with varying density, calculus is employed to find the coordinates of the center of mass along each axis. This involves integrating the product of the mass element and its position relative to a reference point over the entire object and then dividing by the total mass.

###### Definitions:
- <u>Fulcrum:</u> The point where a lever balances on a perpendicular pivot.

- <u>Moment:</u> A force acting perpendicular to the *Fulcrum*/Pivot Point. The tendency of this force to cause a rotation about the pivot point is called the *The Moment of Force*, or more simply, as *Torque*.

- <u>Law of the Lever:</u> If masses *m<sub>1</sub>* and *m<sub>2</sub>* are attached to a rod on opposite sides of a *Fulcrum* at distances *d<sub>1</sub>* and *d<sub>2</sub>* (from the *Fulcrum*), then the rod will balance if *m<sub>1</sub>d<sub>1</sub> =  m<sub>2</sub>d<sub>2</sub>*. This is known as the **Law of the Lever**.

- *Additional Note:* The numbers *m<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub>* and *m<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub>* are called the *moments* of the masses *m<sub>1</sub>* and *m<sub>2</sub>* In general, if we have a system of *n* particles with masses *m<sub>1</sub>, m<sub>2</sub>*, ...*m<sub>n</sub>* , located at the points *x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>*, ...*x<sub>n</sub>* on the x-axis, it can be shown that the center of mass of the system is located at
