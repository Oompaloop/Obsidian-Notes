#### Topic 5: Arc Length and Surface Area

###### Introduction 
*What do we mean by the length of a curve?
You can think of measuring the curve by fitting a piece of string to the curve and then
measuring the string on your ruler. But this might be very hard to do with any
accuracy, especially if your curve is complicated.*

*To find the precise definition for the arc length we will proceed as we did when we
found the area under a curve.
*Suppose that a continuous curve C is defined by the equation:* $y=f(x)$, *where* $a \leq x \leq b$. 

*We are going to divide the interval $[a,b]$ into $n$ equal subintervals, connect the endpoints
of each subinterval with a line segment, and then sum the lengths of each of these line
segments. Of course, our approximation will get better as* $n \to \infty$.

##### <u>Calculating Arc Length:</u>
###### Definitions:
- *If $f'$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, then the length of the curve $y=f(x)$ where $a \leq x \leq b$ is $L = \int_{a}^{b}\sqrt{1+[f'(x)]^2}dx$*
- *Similarly, if $g'$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, then the length of the curve $x=g(y)$ where $c \leq y \leq d$ is $L = \int_{c}^{d}\sqrt{1+[g'(y)]^2}dy$.*
