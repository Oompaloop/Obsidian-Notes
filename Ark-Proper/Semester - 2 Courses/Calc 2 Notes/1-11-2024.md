*Review:*
Just as how one can solve for the area of an enclosed region in terms of x (vertically), we can also solve for the same area in terms of y (horizontally). 
V:  f(x) = y
H: f(y) = x
*Notes:*

###### Example 1:

###### Example 2:
 <u>Use calculus to find the area of the triangle with vertices (-2,5), (5,2), and (0,-3)</u>

Volume by Cross-Sectional Area

For a solid 'S' that is not a cylinder, we first cut 'S' into pieces `\Delta`
